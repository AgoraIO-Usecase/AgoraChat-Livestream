## Function implementation

### Join the chat room

1. Fetch the livestream rooms

```javascript
/**
 *  Fetch the livestream rooms.
 */
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/appserver/liverooms?limit=2&cursor=107776865009666 -H 'Authorization: Bearer $token ' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

2. Join the chat room.

```javascript
/**
 *  Join the chat room
 *
 *  @param options
 *  @param roomId The chat room ID
 */

let options = {
  roomId: "roomId",
};
conn.joinChatRoom(options).then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
});
```

3. Listen for messages.

```javascript
conn.addEventHandler("CHATROOM", {
	onCustomMessage: (msg) => {   			// A custom message was received.
		console.log('onCustomMessage',msg);
	},
	onTextMessage: (msg) => {   			// A text message was received.
		console.log('onTextMessage',msg);
	},
	onChatroomChange: (event) => {
		console.log('onChatroomChange',event); // The chat room notification event was received.
	}
)
```

4. Send a text message.

```javascript
function sendPrivateText() {
  let option = {
    chatType: "chatRoom", // Session type, set to chat room.
    type: "txt", // Message type.
    to: "roomId", // Message receiver (user ID).
    msg: "message content", // Message content.
  };
  let msg = WebIM.message.create(option);
  connection
    .send(msg)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("send private text Success");
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      console.log("Send private text error");
    });
}
```

5. Get the live chat room details from the appServer and get the membership list.

```
/**
 * Get the live chat room details
 */
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/appserver/liverooms/107776865009665 -H 'Authorization: Bearer $token' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

6. Get a mute list of live chat room.

```javascript
/**
 * Gets all muted members in the chat room.
 */

conn.getChatRoomMutelist({ chatRoomId: "chatRoomId" });
```

7. Unmutes a live chat room audience.

```javascript
/**
 * Unmutes the chat room member. Only the chat room owner can call this method.
 */

conn.unmuteChatRoomMember({ chatRoomId: "chatRoomId", username: "user1" });
```

8. get the allow list of the live chat room.

```javascript
/**
 * Gets the allow list of the chat room.
 *
 * Only the chat room owner or admin can call this method.
 */
conn.getChatRoomWhitelist({ chatRoomId: "chatRoomId" });
```

9. Remove the audience from the allow list.

```javascript
/**
 * Removes members from the allow list of the chat room. Only the chat room owner or admin can call this method.
 */
conn.removeChatRoomAllowlistMember({
  chatRoomId: "chatRoomId",
  userName: "user1",
});
```

### Chat room message list

The chat room message list and input box are functions in UIKit. For details, please refer to the chat room section of chat-uikit

## New feature: custom message body

The "gift" function implemented by this demo uses "custom message body" to construct transmission messages

```javascript
function sendCustomMsg() {
  let option = {
    chatType: "chatRoom",
    type: "custom",
    to: "userID",
    customEvent: "chatroom_gift", // Custom Events
    customExts: {
      gift_id: "gift_id",
      gift_num: "gift_num",
    },
  };
  let msg = WebIM.message.create(option);
  connection
    .send(msg)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("success");
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      console.log("fail");
    });
}
```
